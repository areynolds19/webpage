	        <h2>The "Blind" River Dolphin</h2>
	        	<p>Found in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, the Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems and
	        	the Indus River, the South Asian river dolphin lives up to its name. They have 
	        	long beaks and pointed teeth for eating prey, and long fins. Along with this they have a 
	        	"stocky" body that is usually grey, pale blue, or light brown in color. They are
	        	nicknamed "blind" because they have small eyes that are lacking a crystalline
	        	lens, making them hard to see out of. Like other dolphins, they have a
	        	blowhole at the top of their heads.</p>
	        <h2>Facts About The South Asian River Dolphin</h2>
	        	<p>There are two types of South Asian river dolphins: the Indus bhulan
	        	and Ganges susu. However, this classification is generally disregarded. When
	        	the species was thriving, they were often found in schools in the rivers. Now,
	        	generally are found alone, in a pair, and sometimes in a small group. They swim on
	        	their sides, their fins touching the river bottom, scanning for food. Their diet
	        	consists of many fish and even some freshwater sharks! The average life span 
	        	is unknown, but the oldest recorded was a male at the age of 28 years
	        	old!</p>

	        <h2>Conservation</h2>
	        	<p>With only <b>less than 4,000</b> populating the earth, the South Asian
	        	River Dolphin is extremely endangered. Overpopulation has ultimately been
	        	the cause of their endangerment. They are illegally hunted for several 
	        	reasons, but are sometimes accidentally captured in large fishing nets. Chemical
	        	pollution and overgrown greenery have also contributed to the reduction of this
	        	species. They are not a commonly talked about species, therefore little is being
	        	done to protect them. WWF is currently working in India to protect these 
	        	dolphins from fishers, and are trying to prevent further pollution of the rivers. 
	        	They are also working in Nepal to reduce threats to this endangered species.
	        	To help, please spread awareness so we can save this incredible animal!</p>
