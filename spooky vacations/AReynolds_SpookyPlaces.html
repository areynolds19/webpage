<!--What this location offers - why you should go there-->		
		<h4 style="text-align:center;"><font face="Arial">Ghost City Inn was built in the 1890s as
		a boarding house for miners, but was later used for a variety of things, such as an ashram and a restaurant. 
		It is home to a female spirit that is most often seen in the Cleopatra Hill Home. There are also claims of a
		male spirit lurking through the halls. In addition to these sightings, you may also hear doors slamming, and
		strange voices when you are in a room alone.</h4>

			<blockquote><i>"My wife and I just returned from our 4 night stay at the Ghost City Inn...The room was 
		clean and comfortable. I found the bathroom, albeit clean, to be a bit spooky. Once, for no reason at all, the hair on the back 
		of my neck stood up and I had the feeling someone or something was with me...I would highly recommend The Ghost City Inn to anyone 
		traveling in central Arizona."</i></blockquote>
			<br />
			<blockquote><i>"You could not ask for a better hostess than Jackie Muma. She is great as is her cooking, the inn and the view. 
			I recommend this B&B, as long as you don't mind a few uninvited guests joining you. Don't worry, they're harmless and they 
			leave you alone. It is worth the 158 curves in 12 miles to get to Jerome and when you do, make sure you stay at the Ghost City Inn."</i></blockquote>
			<br />
			<blockquote><i>"My room was very creepy, yet, ironically, it was very comfortable! I had a few spooks, but nothing too traumatic. I would
			definitely go back and recommend it to anyone staying in the area. Don't stay anywhere but The Ghost City Inn!"</i></blockquote>
