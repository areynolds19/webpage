	    	<p><b>Ada Lovelace</b>, "Enchantress of Numbers," was the first computer programmer. 
	    	Unlike most women of her time, Lovelace was raised being taught science and math. 
	    	After showing a natural ability, she received teaching from many prestigious people, 
	    	including Mary Somerville, one of the first women to be included in the Royal 
	    	Astronomical Society.</p> 
	    	<p><img id="bio2" src="Ada_Lovelace_portrait_circa_1840.jpg" alt="Ada Lovelace B&W"
	    	title="Ada Lovelace B&W" />However, Lovelace's most notable mentor was Charles Babbage, 
	    	the "father of the computer." From him she was able to form her ideas about coding. She created an 
	    	article from a lecture that Babbage gave and explained her original ideas, but 
	    	received little recognition. These ideas turned out to be used to create a machine 
	    	algorithm that calculated Bernoulli numbers. She also predicted that computers could do 
	    	more than just calculate numbers. She presented the idea that they could be used to create 
	    	music, show pictures, and advance scientific discoveries. Soon after, she wrote this, she
	    	died of uterine cancer at the age of 36. About 90 years after, a man named Alan Turing used
	    	her work to create <i>The Universal Turing Machine.</i></p>
	    <!-- Quote by Lovelace -->
	    	<blockquote><b><i>"Those who have learned to walk on the threshold of the unknown worlds, 
	    	by means of what are commonly termed par excellence the exact sciences, may then, 
	    	with the fair white wings of imagination, hope to soar further into the unexplored 
	    	amidst which we live."</i></b></blockquote>
